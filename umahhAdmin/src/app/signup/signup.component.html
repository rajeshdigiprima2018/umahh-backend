            <strong>Forums</strong><br/> As used in these Terms of Use, "Forum" means an area, site, or feature (such as
            chat rooms, bulletin boards, and e-mail or instant messaging features) offered as part of the website that enables
            visitors to submit, display and/or view content and/or to communicate, share, or exchange content with other
            website visitors and members of the general public. Any submission may be routed through our servers, third party
            servers on our behalf, and the Internet (where it may be viewed by the general public), so you have no expectation
            of privacy for any submitted content. Since we cannot guarantee security of information on a Forum, your use
            is at your own risk.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are not responsible for the accuracy of any user content contained in any Forum or otherwise on our website.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Submitted Content</strong><br/> There are two general situations where you might submit content to us
            via the Internet or other means. The first is in connection to promotional activity. The second is in connection
            with a Forum. In the event you submit any content such as ideas, photographs, or works of authorship in connection
            with any promotion, in consideration of your entry you will, by your submission, be deemed to have assigned to
            us all right, title, and interest in the intellectual property or other property interest in the content you
            may have and you agree to execute any further documentation to effect or memorialize the transfer.
        </p>
        <p>
            In connection with submissions to any Forum, we claim no ownership rights in any content (i.e., text, images, photos, video,
            sounds, or any other materials) that you post, except as provided in these Terms of Use. However, if you do post
            content on any Forum, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use, modify,
            publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, sublicense, and distribute the content in connection with our
            website. Further, you agree to waive any "moral rights" associated with the content. If terms other than those
            provided in these Terms of Use apply to your submission, we will post those terms on the website at the location
            of the feature or activity.
        </p>
        <p>
            You represent and warrant that: (1) you own any content posted by you on the website, Forum or otherwise submitted to us,
            and have the right to grant a license as stated in these Terms of Use, and (2) posting and publishing any content
            on or in connection with the website, Forum, or any offering does not violate any third-party intellectual property,
            publicity, privacy, or contract rights. You agree to not submit any content which is libelous, defamatory, obscene,
            pornographic, threatening, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, abusive, illegal, or otherwise objectionable
            that would constitute or encourage a criminal offense, violate the rights of any party, or that would otherwise
            give rise to liability, or violates any law or obligation of confidentiality. You can only use the Forums in
            a noncommercial manner.

            website visitors and members of the general public. Any submission may be routed through our servers, third party
            servers on our behalf, and the Internet (where it may be viewed by the general public), so you have no expectation
            of privacy for any submitted content. Since we cannot guarantee security of information on a Forum, your use
            is at your own risk.

            via the Internet or other means. The first is in connection to promotional activity. The second is in connection
            with a Forum. In the event you submit any content such as ideas, photographs, or works of authorship in connection
            with any promotion, in consideration of your entry you will, by your submission, be deemed to have assigned to
            us all right, title, and interest in the intellectual property or other property interest in the content you
            may have and you agree to execute any further documentation to effect or memorialize the transfer.

            sounds, or any other materials) that you post, except as provided in these Terms of Use. However, if you do post
            content on any Forum, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use, modify,
            publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, sublicense, and distribute the content in connection with our
            website. Further, you agree to waive any "moral rights" associated with the content. If terms other than those
            provided in these Terms of Use apply to your submission, we will post those terms on the website at the location
            of the feature or activity.
        </p>
        <p>
            You represent and warrant that: (1) you own any content posted by you on the website, Forum or otherwise submitted to us,

            on or in connection with the website, Forum, or any offering does not violate any third-party intellectual property,
            publicity, privacy, or contract rights. You agree to not submit any content which is libelous, defamatory, obscene,
            pornographic, threatening, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, abusive, illegal, or otherwise objectionable
            that would constitute or encourage a criminal offense, violate the rights of any party, or that would otherwise
            give rise to liability, or violates any law or obligation of confidentiality. You can only use the Forums in
